## Tic-tac-toe

Play a simple game of tic-tac-toe in the browser with this single-page React code. Each click of the board
displays either an 'X' or 'O' on the game board. A history of the moves is displayed on the right, click
a button in the history list to move back to a previous move. The game will stop when there is either a
winner or there are no more moves.
